1. Write a function that takes a number and gives me the nth
number in the fibonacci sequence
2. Create an input field
3. Create a button that generates the number and puts in on
the screen

Extra Credit
- This font is lame, use Roboto for me
- Give the input field a rounded border
- Add input validation that only allows the button to be pressed 
when only numbers are in the input
