We want you to build an EXTRA cool calculator

1. Create two inputs (Or for extra credit you can create 0-9 buttons)
2. Create the equals, multiplication, addition, subtraction, 
and division operator buttons
3. Create the addition, multiplication, subtractions, and division functions
4. Keep track of the two inputs using state 
(or if you created buttons add to the two states, 
before and after they hit the operator button)
5. When they hit equals, display the result 


Extra Credit
1. Add a modulus button (it's cool if you even know what this is)
2. Add a clear button
3. Make sure you can ONLY add numbers to your inputs if you used them
